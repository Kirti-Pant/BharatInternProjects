PROJECT1: RED WINE QUALITY PREDICTION 
   It's Red Wine Quality Prediction which uses supervised Machine Learning to make predictions whether wine has a good quality or bad quality. 
   Data pre-processing, Data cleaning, Data Visualization and Model Training and Model Prediction are the key fundamentals of this task. 
   Random Forest Classifier is used to make predictions.
PROJECT2: IRIS CLASSIFICATION
    For the Iris classification problem, the model defines the relationship between the sepal and petal measurements and the predicted Iris species.
    Some simple models can be described with a few lines of algebra, but complex machine learning models have a large number of parameters that are difficult to summarize.
    Logistic Regression is used to make predictions.
